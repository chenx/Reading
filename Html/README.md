Web APIs are typically used with JavaScript, although this doesn't always have to be the case.

## HTML5

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5

**First released in 2008, with major update in 2014.**

**Retired in 2018, in favor of the HTML Living Standard.** 

- The "replacement" for HTML5 is not a new, distinct version, but rather the HTML Living Standard, which represents a continuous, evolving definition of HTML.

## New features of HTML5

- New semantic elements. E.g., \<section>, \<article>.
- Enhanced multimedia capabilities by native supports for audio and video
- Provided Web Storage APIs: localStorage, sessionStorage, SQL database (indexDB)
- Enabled websites to access users' geographical location: Geolocation API

## Some of the main HTML5 APIs 

See https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_api_whatis.asp:

1. Geolocation API - This API is used to access the current location of a user (with latitude and longitude).

2. Drag and Drop API - This API enables you to use drag-and-drop features in browsers.

3. Web Storage API - This API has mechanisms to let browsers store key/value pairs (in a more intuitive way than cookies).

4. Web Workers API - This API allows a JavaScript to run in the background, without affecting the performance of the page. Users can continue to do whatever they want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.

5. Server-Sent Events (SSE) API - This API allows a web page to automatically get updates from a server.

6. Canvas API - This API lets you draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.
