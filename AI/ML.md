## Intro

### Perceptrons

Asingle neuron with only one input layer, and no hidden layers.

### Neural Networks

Multi-Layer Perceptrons

In its simplest form, a neural network is made up from:

- An input layer
- A hidden layer
- An output layer

### Deep NN

- Use several hidden layers of neural networks that perform complex operations on massive amounts of data.
- Each successive layer uses the preceding layer as input.

### Deep Learning (DL)

A subset of Machine Learning.

## AI

Artificial Intelligence is a scientific discipline embracing several Data Science fields ranging from narrow AI to strong AI, 
including machine learning, deep learning, big data and data mining.

## ML Perceptrons

https://www.w3schools.com/ai/ai_perceptrons.asp

### Perceptron Learning

- The perceptron can learn from examples through a process called training.
- During training, the perceptron adjusts its weights based on observed errors. This is typically done using a learning algorithm such as the perceptron learning rule or a backpropagation algorithm.
- Perceptrons are often used as the building blocks for more complex neural networks, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) or deep neural networks (DNNs).

### Pattern Recognition

https://www.w3schools.com/ai/ai_recognition.asp

### Training

https://www.w3schools.com/ai/ai_training.asp

Backpropagation

### Testing

### Learning

- Learning is looping.
- Gradient Descent
- Cost function (Error function)
- The Train Function

<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_linear_regression_error.jpg" />

    E is the error (cost)
    N is the total number of observations (points)
    y is the value (label) of each observation
    x is the value (feature) of each observation
    m is the slope (weight)
    b is intercept (bias)
    mx + b is the prediction
    1/N * Nâˆ‘1 is the squared mean value

### Terminology

- Label: label is the thing we want to predict.
- Features: the input
- Models: relationship between the label (y) and the features (x)
- Training
- Inference: the trained model is used to infer (predict) values using live data
- Phases:
  - Training: Input data are used to calculate the parameters of the model.
  - Inference: The "trained" model outputs correct data from any input.

<br/>

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
  - non-supervised learning but receives feedback from the user whether the decision is good or bad
- Self-Supervised Learning
  - similar to unsupervised learning because it works with data without human added labels.
  - The difference is that unsupervised learning uses clustering, grouping, and dimensionality reduction, while self-supervised learning draw its own conclusions for regression and classification tasks.

### Data

Sampling Terms
- Population
- Census
- Sample
  - Random samples
  - Sampling bias

Census vs Sample
- A Census is when we collect data for every member of a group.
- A Sample is when we collect data for some members of a group.
- A census is Accurate, but hard to do. A sample is Inaccurate, but is easier to do.

Big Data, Data mining

### Clustering

Clustering is a type of Unsupervised Learning.

Clustering is trying to:

    Collect similar data in groups
    Collect dissimilar data in other groups

Clustering Methods

    Density Method
    Hierarchical Method
    Partitioning Method
    Grid-based Method

Correlation Coefficient


### Regressions

Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

### Deep Learning

The deep learning revolution started around 2010.

Since then, Deep Learning has solved many "unsolvable" problems.

#### Neurons

Scientists agree that our brain has between 80 and 100 billion neurons.

These neurons have hundreds of billions connections between them.

#### Tom Mitchell

Tom Michael Mitchell (born 1951) is an American computer scientist and University Professor at the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

#### The Giraffe Story

In 2015, Matthew Lai, a student at Imperial College in London created a neural network called Giraffe.

Giraffe could be trained in 72 hours to play chess at the same level as an international master.

Computers playing chess are not new, but the way this program was created was new.

Smart chess playing programs take years to build, while Giraffe was built in 72 hours with a neural network.

### Brain.js


# TensorFlow.js

https://www.w3schools.com/ai/ai_tensorflow_intro.asp

A popular JavaScript library for Machine Learning.

## Tensors

- TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library to define and operate on Tensors.
- The main data type in TensorFlow.js is the Tensor.
- A Tensor is much the same as a multidimensional array.
- A Tensor contains values in one or more dimensions:

Teasor properties:
- dtype	The data type
- rank	The number of dimensions
- shape	The size of each dimension

### Creating a Tensor

- The main data type in TensorFlow is the Tensor.
- A Tensor is created from any N-dimensional array with the tf.tensor() method:

Tensor Shape

- A Tensor can also be created from an array and a shape parameter: 

### Retrieve Tensor Values

- You can get the data behind a tensor using tensor.data()
- You can get the array behind a tensor using tensor.array()
- tensor.rank, tensor.shape, tensor.dtype

### Tensor Data Types

A Tensor can have the following data types:

    bool
    int32
    float32 (default)
    complex64
    string

## TensorFlow Operations

    Add
    Subtract
    Multiply
    Divide
    Square
    Reshape

tensor.reshape()
- The number of elements in a tensor is the product of the sizes in the shape.
- Since there can be different shapes with the same size, it is often useful to reshape a tensor to other shapes with the same size.

<br/>

## TensorFlow Models

Models and Layers are important building blocks in Machine Learning.

- TensorFlow.js is supporting different types of Models and different types of Layers.
- A TensorFlow Model is a Neural Network with one or more Layers.

### A Tensorflow Project

## Tensors

A Tensor is a N-dimensional Matrix:

- A Scalar is a 0-dimensional tensor
- A Vector is a 1-dimensional tensor
- A Matrix is a 2-dimensional tensor

A Tensor is a generalization of Vectors and Matrices to higher dimensions.

### Tensor Ranks

The number of directions a tensor can have in a N-dimensional space, is called the Rank of the tensor.

The rank is denoted R.

A Scalar is a single number.

    It has 0 Axes
    It has a Rank of 0
    It is a 0-dimensional Tensor

A Vector is an array of numbers.

    It has 1 Axis
    It has a Rank of 1
    It is a 1-dimensional Tensor

A Matrix is a 2-dimensional array.

    It has 2 Axis
    It has a Rank of 2
    It is a 2-dimensional Tensor

### Real Tensors

Technically, all of the above are tensors, but when we speak of tensors, we generally speak of matrices with a dimension larger than 2 (R > 2).

### JavaScript Tensor Operations

One of the most common libraries to use for tensor operations is called tensorflow.js.

```Tensor Addition:
const tensorA = tf.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]);
const tensorB = tf.tensor([[1,-1], [2,-2], [3,-3]]);

// Tensor Addition
const tensorAdd = tensorA.add(tensorB);

// Result [ [2, 1], [5, 2], [8, 3] ]
```

# Statistics

## Statistics

### Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics are methods for quantifying properties of a population from a small Sample.

### Descriptive Statistics

Inferential statistics are methods for quantifying properties of a population from a small Sample:

#### Descriptive Statistics Measurements

Descriptive statistics are broken down into different measures:

**Tendency (Measures of the Center)**

    The Mean (the average value)value
    The Median (the mid point value)
    The Mode (the most common value)
    The Outlier

**Spread (Measures of Variability)**

    Min and Max
    Standard Deviation
    Variance
    Distribution
    Skewness
    Kurtosis

<br/>

## Descriptive Statistics (Tendancy)

## Statistic Variability (Spread)

## Distribution

- What is Normal Distribution?
- What is Margin of Error?
- What is Skewness?
  - Skewness is a distortion (an asymmetry) from the bell curve (normal distribution).
- What is Kurtosis?
  - Kurtosis is a also a distortion from the normal distribution (bell curve).
  - While skewness describes a unexpected values in one tail, kurtosis describes unexpected values in both tails.

## Probability

Probability is about how Likely something is to occur, or how likely something is true.
