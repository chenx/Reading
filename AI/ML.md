## Intro

### Perceptrons

Asingle neuron with only one input layer, and no hidden layers.

### Neural Networks

Multi-Layer Perceptrons

In its simplest form, a neural network is made up from:

- An input layer
- A hidden layer
- An output layer

### Deep NN

- Use several hidden layers of neural networks that perform complex operations on massive amounts of data.
- Each successive layer uses the preceding layer as input.

### Deep Learning (DL)

A subset of Machine Learning.

## AI

Artificial Intelligence is a scientific discipline embracing several Data Science fields ranging from narrow AI to strong AI, 
including machine learning, deep learning, big data and data mining. 

AI (narrow AI) >> ML >> NN >> DL (Big Data, Strong AI)

### Narrow AI

Narrow Artificial Intelligence is limited to narrow (specific) areas like most of the AI we have around us today:

    Email spam Filters
    Text to Speech
    Speech Recognition
    Self Driving Cars
    E-Payment
    Google Maps
    Text Autocorrect
    Automated Translation
    Chatbots
    Social Media
    Face Detection
    Visual Perception
    Search Algorithms
    Robots
    Automated Investment
    NLP - Natural Language Processing
    Flying Drones
    IBM's Dr. Watson
    Apple's Siri
    Microsoft's Cortana
    Amazon's Alexa
    Netflix's Recommendations

Narrow AI is also called Weak AI.

Weak AI: Built to simulate human intelligence.

Strong AI: Built to copy human intelligence.

### Strong AI

Strong Artificial Intelligence is the type of AI that mimics human intelligence.

## ML languages

Programming languages involved in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are:

    LISP
    R
    Python
    C++
    Java
    JavaScript
    SQL

### R

R is a programming language for Graphics and Statistical computing.

R comes with a wide set of statistical and graphical techniques for:

    Linear Modeling
    Nonlinear Modeling
    Statistical Tests
    Time-series Analysis
    Classification
    Clustering

### Python

An advantage for using Python is that it comes with some very suitable libraries:

    NumPy (Library for working with Arrays)
    SciPy (Library for Statistical Science)
    Matplotlib (Graph Plotting Library)
    NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
    TensorFlow (Machine Learning)

### JavaScript

JavaScript Machine Learning Libraries

#### Brain.js
#### ml5.js
#### Math.js

#### TensorFlow 

TensorFLow playground: https://playground.tensorflow.org/

#### Plotting in the Browser

Here is a list of some JavaScript libraries to use for both Machine Learning graphs and other HTML charts:

    HTML Canvas
    Plotly.js
    Chart.js
    Google Chart
    D3.js

### WebGL API

- WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering 2d and 3D graphics in any browser.
- WebGL can run on both integrated and standalone graphic cards in any PC.
- WebGL brings 3D graphics to the web browser. Major browser vendors Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Edge), and Mozilla (Firefox) are members of the WebGL Working Group.

## ML Perceptrons

### Perceptron Learning

- The perceptron can learn from examples through a process called training.
- During training, the perceptron adjusts its weights based on observed errors. This is typically done using a learning algorithm such as the perceptron learning rule or a backpropagation algorithm.
- Perceptrons are often used as the building blocks for more complex neural networks, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) or deep neural networks (DNNs).
