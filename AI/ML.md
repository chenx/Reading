## Intro

### Perceptrons

Asingle neuron with only one input layer, and no hidden layers.

### Neural Networks

Multi-Layer Perceptrons

In its simplest form, a neural network is made up from:

- An input layer
- A hidden layer
- An output layer

### Deep NN

- Use several hidden layers of neural networks that perform complex operations on massive amounts of data.
- Each successive layer uses the preceding layer as input.

### Deep Learning (DL)

A subset of Machine Learning.

## AI

Artificial Intelligence is a scientific discipline embracing several Data Science fields ranging from narrow AI to strong AI, 
including machine learning, deep learning, big data and data mining. 

AI (narrow AI) >> ML >> NN >> DL (Big Data, Strong AI)

### Narrow AI

Narrow Artificial Intelligence is limited to narrow (specific) areas like most of the AI we have around us today:

    Email spam Filters
    Text to Speech
    Speech Recognition
    Self Driving Cars
    E-Payment
    Google Maps
    Text Autocorrect
    Automated Translation
    Chatbots
    Social Media
    Face Detection
    Visual Perception
    Search Algorithms
    Robots
    Automated Investment
    NLP - Natural Language Processing
    Flying Drones
    IBM's Dr. Watson
    Apple's Siri
    Microsoft's Cortana
    Amazon's Alexa
    Netflix's Recommendations

Narrow AI is also called Weak AI.

Weak AI: Built to simulate human intelligence.

Strong AI: Built to copy human intelligence.

### Strong AI

Strong Artificial Intelligence is the type of AI that mimics human intelligence.
