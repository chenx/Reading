# Promise

A mode of Asynchromous programming. 

### 3 states of a Promise object

pending, fulfilled, rejected

### Async operation

A Promise object is a pending operation to be fulfilled

### How

Chained invocation by .then() and .catch() functions.

Error handling: .catch()

Parallel processing: Promise.all(), continue execution after all promises finish.

### Where

Interaction with backend API. 

For example, a HTTP request by axios or fetch returns a Promise object.
