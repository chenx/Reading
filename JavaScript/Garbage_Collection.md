# Garbage Collection in JavaScript

JavaScript utilizes automatic memory management through a process called garbage collection. This means developers typically do not need to manually allocate or deallocate memory, as is required in languages like C or C++. The JavaScript engine handles this automatically in the background.

The core principle behind JavaScript's garbage collection is to identify and reclaim memory that is no longer reachable or "in use" by the program. The most common algorithm used for this is **Mark-and-Sweep**.

How Mark-and-Sweep Works:

- Marking Phase:
  - The garbage collector starts from a set of "root" objects (e.g., global variables, objects on the call stack)
    that are known to be reachable. It then traverses the object graph, marking all objects that can be reached
    from these roots as "active" or "in use." This process recursively marks all objects that are referenced
    directly or indirectly by reachable objects.
- Sweeping Phase:
  - After the marking phase, the garbage collector iterates through all objects in memory. Any objects that were
    not marked during the marking phase are considered "unreachable" or "garbage" and are then swept away (deallocated),
    freeing up their memory for future use.

### Key Concepts and Considerations:

- Reachability:
    An object is considered reachable if there is a path of references from a root object to that object.
- Memory Leaks:
    While garbage collection automates memory management, it's still possible to create memory leaks in JavaScript. This occurs when objects that are no longer functionally needed by the application are still technically reachable (e.g., due to lingering event listeners, closures holding references, or circular references that the garbage collector cannot efficiently break).
- Performance Impact:
    Garbage collection is a background process, but it can occasionally cause minor pauses or performance hiccups, especially in applications with very high memory usage or frequent object creation and destruction.
- Optimization:
    Developers can write code that helps the garbage collector work more efficiently by minimizing unnecessary object allocations, promptly removing event listeners, and breaking circular references when objects are no longer needed.
