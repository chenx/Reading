# MongoDB

MongoDB is available both as an online cloud service (MongoDB Atlas) and as downloadable software (Community/Enterprise Server). 
You can use it in the cloud for no-setup deployment or download it to run locally on your own hardware (Windows, macOS, Linux). 

- Online (MongoDB Atlas): Fully managed, cloud-based database-as-a-service (DBaaS) that removes the need for installation and maintenance.
- Downloadable (Community/Enterprise Server): Self-managed, free, and open-source version that you install on your own infrastructure.
- Tools: MongoDB Compass (GUI) and mongosh (Shell) are also available for download to interact with your data. 

For most users starting, MongoDB Atlas is recommended for ease of use.
