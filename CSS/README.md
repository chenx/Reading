## CSS3

Unlike previous versions, CSS3 was not released as a single, monolithic specification. Instead, it was divided into several separate modules, each introducing new features and capabilities. Key modules include:

- Selectors
- Box Model
- Backgrounds and Borders
- Text Effects
- 2D/3D Transformations
- Animations
- Flexbox
- Grid Layout

Key Features and Innovations

- Responsive Design: CSS3 introduced media queries, enabling the creation of responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.
- Advanced Layouts: Flexbox and Grid provide powerful layout mechanisms, simplifying the creation of complex web layouts that are responsive and adaptable.
- Visual Enhancements: Transitions, animations, and transformations allow for the creation of dynamic, interactive user interfaces without relying on JavaScript.

## CSS4, CSS5

"CSS4" and "CSS5" aren't official W3C version names for the Cascading Style Sheets standard but are rather informal, community-driven terms to categorize CSS features by their development timeline, roughly dividing them into CSS4 (features from 2013-2018) and CSS5 (features from 2019-2024) to help organize and discuss new additions.


Key characteristics:

### CSS3:

Established a broad set of core functionalities, including flexible box layouts, grid layouts, custom properties, and responsive design principles. 

### CSS4 (2013-2018):

### CSS5 (2019-2024):
